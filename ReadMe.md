# OSRM Text Instructions (Java)
This library was my "take" on converting the useful [OSRM Text Instructions](https://github.com/Project-OSRM/osrm-text-instructions) library that is programmed in javascript into a java project. While a [java version has already been created](https://github.com/Project-OSRM/osrm-text-instructions.java/), it doesn't seem to be maintained currently to keep it up to date with the main project. I had the need and idea to port the node module by running a V8 instance on the JVM using the wonderful [J2V8 library](https://github.com/eclipsesource/J2V8) and allowing direct calls to the main javascript library from Java. This will make keeping up the development simple as new functionality arises. 

I did copy some testing code and idea to use the [MapBox LegStep](https://www.mapbox.com/android-docs/api/mapbox-java/libjava-services/2.2.9/com/mapbox/services/api/directions/v5/models/LegStep.html) model to supplement the [OSRM RouteStep object](https://github.com/Project-OSRM/osrm-backend/blob/master/docs/http.md#routestep-object) required in the compile steps. 

I have pre-installed the node modules in the resource folders to avoid the user needing to install node.js or npm themselves just to install the osrm-text-instructions module. If, however, you want the latest version you will need install both of these reqirements yourself and run `node install osrm-text-instructions` in the resource folder. You will also need to pay special attention to the version number specified in the javascript library and make sure it matches whatever version you wish to use.
